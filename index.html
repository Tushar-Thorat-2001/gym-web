   <h3> Knowledge,Skill&Hardwork</h3>
   <p>Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”</p>

   <h3>All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.’</h3>
   <p>Sometimes, no matter how important your goals are to you, it's a struggle to bring your best effort to your gym session (or work up the motivation to make it happen at all). But whether you're trying to lose weight, train for a race, keep your stress in check, or any of the other worthwhile reasons to make fitness a part of your life, staying consistent is key</p>
